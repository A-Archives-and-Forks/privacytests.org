# resist-fingerprinting-js

This project allows browsers to be tested for fingerprintability via information leaks in certain JS and CSS APIs. We are simultaneously developing a series of mitigations that plug some of these leaks. The fingerprinting tests also serve as unit tests for the mitigations.

We hope to test many browsers using BrowserStack.com:
