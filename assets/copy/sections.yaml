    A common vulnerability of web browsers is that they allow tracking companies
    to 'tag' your browser with some data ('state') that identifies you. When third-party trackers
    are embedded in websites, they can see this identifying data as you browse to different
    websites. Fortunately, it is possible for this category of leaks to be fixed by partitioning
    all data stored in the browser such that no data can be shared between websites.

  description: >
    When you click a hyperlink to navigate your browser from one site to another, certain
    browser APIs allow the first site to communicate to the second site. These privacy
    vulnerabilities can be fixed by introducing new limits on how much data is transfered
    between sites.',

  name: "HTTPS tests"
  description: >
    HTTPS is the protocol that web browsers use to connect securely to websites. When
    HTTPS is being used, the connection is encrypted so
    that third parties on the network cannot read content being sent between the
    server and your browser. In the past, insecure connections were the default and websites
    would need to actively request that a browser use HTTPS. Now the status quo is shifting,
    and browser makers are moving toward a world where HTTPS is the default protocol.`

  description: >
    Fingerprinting is a technique trackers use to uniquely identify you as you browse the web.
    A fingerprinting script will measure several characteristics of your browser and, combining
    this data, will build a fingerprint that may uniquely identify you among web users.
    Browsers can introduce countermeasures, such as minimizing the distinguishing information
    disclosed by certain web APIs so your browser is harder to pick out from the crowd
    (so-called 'fingerprinting resistance').`,

- category: "query"
  name: "Tracking query parameter tests"
  description: >
    When you browse from one web page to another, tracking companies will frequently attach
    a 'tracking query parameter' to the address of the second web page. That query parameter
    may contain a unique identifier that tracks you individually as you browse the web. And
    these query parameters are frequently synchronized with cookies, making them a powerful
    tracking vector. Web browsers can protect you from known tracking query parameters by
    stripping them from web addresses before your browser sends them. (The set of
    tracking query parameters tested here was largely borrowed from Brave.)`

- category: "trackers"
  name: "Tracker content blocking"
  description: >
    When you visit a web page, it frequently has third-party embedded tracking content, such
    as scripts and tracking pixels. These embedded components spy on you. Some browsers and
    browser extensions maintain list of tracking companies and block their content from
    being loaded.

    A large fraction of web pages on the web have hidden third-party trackers that read and
    write cookies in your browser. These cookies can be used to track your browsing across
    websites.
