# Frequently Asked Questions for PrivacyTests.org

## Is this website a secret advertisement for Browser X?

No -- this website was created independently and is my best effort to bring to light the privacy characteristics of each browser, using objective, reproducible tests. It is my long-term goal to make these tests as comprehensive as possible.

## Which browser is best for privacy?

I'm glad you asked! The results show that no browser is perfect. Also, there are tradeoffs between usability and privacy, which means the best browser for you may not be the best browser for me.

## Can you add a score for each browser?

It is difficult to objectively weight the different kinds of tests to produce an objective score. Rather I encourage everyone to examine all the results.

## Why are all iOS browsers so good at state partitioning?

All browsers on iOS are required by Apple to use the WebKit engine (the basis of Safari). That means they have many privacy characteristics in common, including fairly comprehensive (but not perfect) state partitioning.
